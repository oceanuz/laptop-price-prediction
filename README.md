Laptop Price Prediction

This project predicts laptop prices using Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression. It covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, cross-validation, and performance evaluation with R² and MSE metrics.

📌 Project Goals

Build regression models to estimate laptop prices

Compare model performance (Linear vs Polynomial)

Evaluate models using R², MSE, and cross-validation

Visualize predictions and residuals
